# Recap: Understanding Queues

Queues operate on the principle of "First In - First Out" (FIFO), meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. This concept is useful in various scenarios, including job interviews.

Queues find applications in:

1. Job Interviews
2. Process Scheduling
3. Print Spooling
4. Message Queues

Understanding queues and their FIFO behavior is valuable in software development and system design. So remember, "First In - First Out," and you'll be prepared for queue-related challenges!
