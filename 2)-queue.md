# Queues

A queue, also known as FIFO (First-In-First-Out), is a simple concept. 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️🚌

Imagine a line of people waiting for a bus at a bus stop. 🚏 The first person to arrive is the first to board the bus, and as more people join the line, they stand behind the others. 

Similarly, in a queue:
- The first element added is the first to be processed or removed. ✅
- When new elements join the queue, they line up behind the existing elements. ⬅️⬅️⬅️
- When an element is processed or removed, the next element in line becomes the first. ❌✅


### Real life scenarios of usage of this concept 
- Call Centers and Customer Support
- Web Servers and Request Handling
- Ticketing Systems

It's always the same, the first thing being attended/cared, is the first to be thrown away
