# Performance and Big(O) Notation

In order to understand how these types of data structures work and why they are important in the real world, we need to understand two things:

1. Why Performance 💸💸
2. Why Big(O) Notation 💰💰💰

### Performance is a critical aspect of software development. 
- It refers to how well a program or algorithm performs in terms of execution time and resource usage. 

Analyzing performance helps us to: 
- identify bottlenecks, 
- optimize code, 
- and improve the overall efficiency of our software.

### Big O notation
*It is a mathematical notation used to describe the performance characteristics of an algorithm.* 

It provides a way to classify algorithms based on: 
- how their execution time or space requirements grow as the input size increases.

Basically, Big O helps us understand how efficient our software is (or isn't).

Real-life scenarios where Big O is really useful include:
- Sorting and Searching 🔍
- Machine Learning and Optimization 🔬👨‍💻
- Data Processing and Analysis 🗂️📊
- Overall, software in general 🔠👨🏾‍💻👩🏻‍💻
