# Recap: Sets

Sets are a valuable data type that can be used with lists. Here are some key points to remember:

- Sets allow us to perform operations efficiently, usually in constant time (O(1).
- Sets do not allow duplicates, ensuring that each element is unique.
- Sets do not maintain any specific ordering of elements.

By utilizing sets, we can efficiently perform various operations on elements, benefiting from their unique and unordered nature.
