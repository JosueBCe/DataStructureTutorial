ðŸ”ƒ Recursion is a technique wherein a function calls itself.

Base case: It represents the simplest form of the problem.
Recursive step: It denotes the smallest step that the function can take to resolve a problem.

To understand recursion better, let's consider an example of a recursive function that calculates the factorial of a number:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # Base case: factorial of 0 is 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)  # Recursive step: n multiplied by factorial of (n-1)
```

Here's how the recursion unfolds when calling factorial(4):

1) factorial(4) is called.
2) Since n is not equal to 0, the function enters the else block.
3) It returns n (which is 4) multiplied by factorial(n-1) (which is factorial(3)).
4) Now, a new recursive call factorial(3) is made.
5) This process continues until the base case is reached:
6) factorial(3) returns 3 * factorial(2)
7) factorial(2) returns 2 * factorial(1)
8) factorial(1) returns 1 * factorial(0)
9) Finally, factorial(0) is reached, which immediately returns 1 (the base case).
10) The function starts unwinding the recursive calls, substituting the values back:

```python
    - factorial(1) returns 1 * 1 = 1
    - factorial(2) returns 2 * 1 = 2
    - factorial(3) returns 3 * 2 = 6
    - factorial(4) returns 4 * 6 = 24
```

Finally, the factorial of 4 is **24**.

Now, let's consider another example using Fibonacci numbers:

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. In this example, the `fib` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th Fibonacci number.

The `fib` function follows these steps:

1. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, return 1.
2. Otherwise, recursively call `fib(n-1)` and `fib(n-2)`, and return their sum.

For example, let's consider `fib(3)`:

1. `n = 3`, so it's not less than or equal to 2.
2. `fib(3)` recursively calls `fib(2)` and `fib(1)`.
3. `fib(2)` returns 1 because `n = 2`.
4. `fib(1)` also returns 1 because `n = 1`.
5. Finally, `fib(3)` returns the sum of `fib(2)` and `fib(1)`, which is 2.

The recursive calls continue until the base case is reached, where `n` is less than or equal to 2. By summing the results of the recursive calls, the function computes the Fibonacci number for the given input `n`.

I hope this simplified explanation clarifies the concept of recursion using the Fibonacci example! Let me know if you have any further questions.
